"""Chunk location lookup for recall output (heading_path, lines, real path).

Reads the location fields ``memory migrate-index`` (or the indexers) wrote into
``kv_store_text_chunks.json`` and serves them by chunk id.  Cached per file and
invalidated on mtime, like the BM25 sparse index, so a re-index or migration is
picked up without restarting the server.  Pure read path: no LLM, no embedder.
