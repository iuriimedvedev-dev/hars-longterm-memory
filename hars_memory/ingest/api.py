"""Public ingest API for hars-longterm-memory.

External callers (in-repo scripts, or another project entirely) that have
their own document source -- a database export, an API pull, anything that
isn't a plain file on disk -- construct `Document` objects themselves and
hand them to `ingest_documents()`. This is the one supported integration
point for non-file-walk ingestion; it is what keeps hars_memory itself free
of any particular external system's schema or vocabulary.

Pipeline reuse
--------------
This module does NOT duplicate the chunk -> embed -> extract -> insert
pipeline. It builds a LightRAG instance the same way the CLI entrypoint
(``hars_memory.server.index``) does, via
``hars_memory.server.lightrag_init.create_lightrag()``, and hands the
documents to that same module's ``_insert_all_batches()`` helper -- the
exact function ``server/index.py``'s ``--paths``/``--db-export`` walk-driven
CLI already uses to call ``rag.ainsert()`` in batches. ``ingest_documents()``
is a thin wrapper parameterised by an explicit ``list[Document]`` instead of
a file-walk result.

"documents_written" semantics
------------------------------
A document counts as "written" once it has been hand off to LightRAG's
``ainsert()`` pipeline without that call raising -- i.e. its content and
chunks are durably enqueued in the index. It does NOT require that
downstream entity/relation extraction (the GPU-bound LLM call) succeeded:
LightRAG marks a document ``FAILED`` (with an error message, not a raised
exception) when extraction fails, e.g. because the extractor LLM endpoint is
unreachable, and automatically retries FAILED documents the next time the
enqueue/process pipeline runs (see
``LightRAG.apipeline_process_enqueue_documents``, which pulls
``PENDING``/``PROCESSING``/``FAILED`` docs on every call). Treating "written"
as "durably enqueued for indexing (with self-healing retry)" rather than
"fully graph-extracted this call" is what lets ``ingest_documents()`` be
called safely regardless of whether the extractor LLM happens to be up right
now -- exactly the GPU-optional posture the rest of this package's ingest
path (file walk, change detection) already has. ``errors`` therefore reports
failures of the *insertion call itself* -- ``rag.initialize_storages()``
raising (e.g. a broken vector store), ``rag.adelete_by_doc_id()`` raising, or
``rag.ainsert()`` raising a programming error -- not per-document extraction
failures, which are LightRAG's own concern to retry.

Content fingerprinting DOES gate ``ainsert()`` -- but only for documents that
were previously inserted successfully
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike ``server/index.py``'s walk-driven CLI (which re-hands its *entire*
document set to ``ainsert()`` on every run, gated only by the opt-in
``--refresh-changed`` delete-before-reinsert step), ``ingest_documents()``
uses the content fingerprint (see ``change_detection.py``) to decide, per
document, whether to call ``ainsert()`` at all this call:

* Unchanged content, previously recorded fingerprint matches -- the document
  is SKIPPED, not handed to ``ainsert()``. This is required, not just an
  optimisation: the installed ``lightrag-hku`` package's default
  ``JsonDocStatusStorage.filter_keys()`` is a blunt existence check (any
  doc_id already present in doc_status counts as "seen", regardless of
  whether its status is ``PROCESSED`` or ``FAILED``), and
  ``apipeline_enqueue_documents`` writes a brand-new, non-idempotent
  ``FAILED``/``is_duplicate`` doc_status record (plus a warning log) for
  every doc_id it is asked to enqueue that is already present -- there is no
  free "already processed, no-op" path inside LightRAG itself. Resubmitting
  unchanged, already-successful documents on every call would therefore
  permanently accumulate junk duplicate-marker records in doc_status storage
  on every repeat ingest of the same corpus. Skipping them here is what
  keeps repeat calls over an unchanged corpus (the normal staging ->
  periodic-reingest cycle) side-effect-free.
* No previously recorded fingerprint (never inserted, OR a prior call never
  confirmed a durable success for it -- see below) -- the document IS handed
  to ``ainsert()``. This is what gives a document LightRAG marked ``FAILED``,
  or a document this module never got to persist a fingerprint for, a real
  retry path.
* Changed content (fingerprint differs from what's on record) -- the
  document IS handed to ``ainsert()``, and its stale content is
  force-deleted first (``adelete_by_doc_id``) so LightRAG's doc_id-based
  dedupe cannot silently keep the old content forever.

A fingerprint is only ever persisted (``store.save()``) for a doc_id once
BOTH of the following hold: the delete+insert call for its batch completed
without raising, AND that specific doc_id's ``doc_status`` -- queried
afterwards via ``rag.doc_status.get_docs_by_status(DocStatus.PROCESSED)``
(mirroring the doc-selection pattern
``LightRAG.apipeline_process_enqueue_documents`` itself uses internally) --
came back ``PROCESSED``. The insert call not raising is necessary but NOT
sufficient: per the self-healing model above, a per-document extraction
failure is caught internally and leaves that one doc_id ``FAILED`` without
raising anything, so a batch can complete "successfully" while individual
documents inside it did not. Any doc_id in the batch that is not confirmed
``PROCESSED`` has its provisional fingerprint (recorded in memory by
``detect_changed_documents()`` before the insert ran) discarded before
``store.save()``, so it reverts to "no fingerprint on record" and stays
retry-eligible on the next call -- exactly like a doc_id whose insert call
itself raised. A failed/errored call (an exception anywhere in the
try-block) leaves the on-disk store completely untouched, for the same
reason. Restoring a document to "unchanged, skip it" status therefore only
happens once THAT document, specifically, has been confirmed ``PROCESSED``
-- never merely because the batch call around it didn't raise.
