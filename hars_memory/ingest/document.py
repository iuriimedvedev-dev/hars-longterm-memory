    ``scripts/update_kb.sh`` archives every successfully-indexed staging note
    by moving it from ``staging/<name>.md`` to ``staging/ingested/<name>.md``
    after a run (see that script's ``mkdir -p "$STAGING/ingested"`` /
    ``mv ... "$STAGING/ingested/"`` step). That move inserts exactly one path
    segment named ``ingested`` directly ahead of the filename, and nothing
    else about the path changes.

    Without this normalisation, ``file_stable_id`` (hashing the absolute
    path) would mint a brand-new ID for the identical file the moment it is
    archived, so the walker recursing into ``staging/ingested/`` on the next
    run (nothing currently excludes it — see ``scripts/update_kb.sh``'s
    generated ``.memoryignore``, which is the belt to this braces) would
    look like ~all-new documents to LightRAG and trigger a full re-extraction
    of content already in the index. See
    ``.session/2026-07-30_longterm-memory-overhaul.md`` for the incident this
    fixes: 248 of 249 staged files were about to be re-extracted after a
    single archival round-trip.

    Stripping the segment makes ``staging/x.md`` and ``staging/ingested/x.md``
    hash identically — which is correct, since the archived file IS the
    document that was ingested from the staging path — and reproduces every
    ID already recorded in the live ``kv_store_doc_status.json`` for files
    that predate this fix. Only an exact ``ingested`` component is dropped
    (case-sensitive, no prefix/suffix match), keeping collision risk with an
    unrelated directory that happens to be named ``ingested`` elsewhere in a
    walked root minimal and easy to reason about.
