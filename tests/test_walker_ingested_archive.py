"""Tests for the staging-archive exclusion convention used by
scripts/update_kb.sh (see that script's ".memoryignore" generation step and
ingest/document.py's file_stable_id() docstring for the full bug writeup).

update_kb.sh moves every successfully-indexed staging note into
staging/ingested/ after each run, then (idempotently) ensures
staging/.memoryignore contains an "ingested/" exclude line. This uses
walker.py's existing, already-tested .memoryignore mechanism (see
test_memory_dir_ingest.py::test_memoryignore_respected_in_memory_dir) --
no walker.py code change was needed, only a generated config file at the
walked root, which is exercised here with a synthetic tmp_path staging dir
shaped like the real one.
