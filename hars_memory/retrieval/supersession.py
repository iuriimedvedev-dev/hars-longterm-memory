"""Supersession-aware post-fusion re-scoring for the dense+BM25 fusion channel.

Both signals below are derived PURELY from chunk `content` text already
returned by the dense/sparse channels (the same `[Document: X | Section: Y |
Date: Z]` header LightRAG's own ingest emits once per document, on its first
chunk — see `tools/memory/server/lightrag_init.py`'s header-emission path
and `tools/memory/tests/test_header_emission.py`). No extra I/O, no
embeddings, no LLM call, no reindexation: this module only regexes strings
that are already in memory by the time `fusion.fuse()` runs.

WHY two separate, narrow, additive signals rather than one general "penalize
anything that looks stale" heuristic — measured, not assumed, against the
live index (`kv_store_text_chunks.json`, 2048 docs / 6830 chunks, snapshot
2026-07-12):

1. `marker_penalty` — self-declared frontmatter deprecation.

   Corpus convention: `.memory/` notes (chunk header `Section: memory`, 88 of
   2048 docs, all `Date: unknown` — see module docstring of
   `tools/memory/eval/ab_bench.py`'s companion investigation) are the
   corpus's continuously-curated "current understanding" layer, per
   `project_graphrag_colab_run.md`'s documented MEMORY CYCLE
   (`memory_remember` -> staging -> `update_kb.sh`, GPU-gated). When one of
   these notes is retired, the convention used at least once already in this
   corpus is to prefix its own YAML `name:` field with `DEPRECATED —` and
   open its body with `**THIS MEMORY IS DEPRECATED.**` (see
   `project_hires_hypothesis_disproven.md`).

   REJECTED alternative, tested against the real corpus first: blanket
   keyword search for INVALIDATED/FALSIFIED/SUPERSEDED/etc. ANYWHERE in a
   chunk. This produces false positives on the *correct* documents in this
   very eval set: `project_droid_mapping_v3.md` (the CORRECT doc for sq05)
   contains "fundamentally wrong" describing the OLD v2 map it corrects, not
   itself; `project_b1_sidecar_family_falsified.md` (the CORRECT doc for
   sq03) has `name: b1-sidecar-family-falsified` — the slug names what was
   falsified (a sidecar family), not that this note is stale. A doc reporting
   "X is invalid" is exactly the CURRENT authoritative claim in this corpus's
   supersession queries, not a stale one. Scoped down to "does this chunk's
   OWN `name:` field open with a bare deprecation word" + "does this chunk's
   OWN body open by calling itself out by name" — verified by direct
   full-corpus scan (all 6830 chunks, not just chunk-000) to fire on exactly
   one chunk in the whole snapshot, and it is the correct target (the
   labeled `superseded_docs` entry for query sq01). Zero false positives
   measured, but correspondingly low recall (this convention has only been
   used once so far in the corpus, so this signal fixes exactly one of the
   six labeled supersession queries today) — reported honestly, not oversold,
   rather than widening the marker vocabulary or search zone to manufacture
   more hits on this small labeled set.

2. `recency_discount` — bounded, date-known-only discount.

   Naive symmetric recency (treat "no date" as "infinitely old") was
   considered and REJECTED after measuring the corpus: 5 of the 6 labeled
   supersession `correct_docs` are `Section: memory` chunks with
   `Date: unknown` (the living-document layer above), while their competing
   `superseded_docs` are dated point-in-time `.session`/`.reports` snapshots.
   A naive "prefer newer date, penalize undated as oldest" prior would
   therefore actively fight the correct answer on 4 of the 6 labeled queries
   before it ever helps anything — exactly the failure mode the task
   description warns about ("naive recency is wrong on its own").

   This module instead discounts ONLY chunks whose date is actually known,
   and never touches `Date: unknown` chunks (factor stays 1.0) — an unknown
   date is treated as "no signal", not as "definitely old". Given that
   scoping, the two failure classes cannot conflict: an undated `correct_doc`
   is never discounted, so this signal can only ever help (push a
   *known-older*, on-topic, co-retrieved competitor further down) or be a
   no-op, never actively promote a superseded-but-newer-dated chunk over an
   undated current one. The discount itself is small (capped at
   `MAX_RECENCY_DISCOUNT`, linear ramp, saturating at
   `RECENCY_SATURATION_DAYS`) precisely because "old but still valid" is a
   real failure mode the task calls out explicitly — this is deliberately
   too weak to reorder a dominant, clearly-on-topic older document, only
   enough to break a close tie between near-equally-scored competitors
   retrieved for the same query (the practical, in-budget proxy this module
   uses for "competing on the same claim": both candidates were retrieved
   for the *same* query, which is the cheapest available topical-overlap
   signal without computing pairwise embeddings — see the "not attempted"
   note in the session report for why true topical near-duplication
   detection was out of scope for this pass).

Both factors are OFF by default; gated by `HARS_MEMORY_SUPERSESSION_SCORING`
(see `apply_supersession_scoring`'s caller in `fusion.fuse`).

# --- rank-only entry point (no numeric score available) --------------------

# above, rather than reusing it: `apply_supersession_scoring` is defined on
# `fusion.FusedChunk`, which always carries a `fused_score` to multiplicatively
# attenuate. The caller this function was extracted for
# (`hars_longterm_memory_mcp.py`'s `_merge_context_with_fusion`, item:
# supersession-aware scoring on the FINAL MERGED context) has no such score:
# LightRAG's own mode-based context assembly (naive/local/global/hybrid) never
# exposes a per-chunk score in its rendered `only_need_context=True` output —
# only rank order (see `tools/memory/eval/channels.py`'s `lightrag_mode`,
# which documents and relies on the identical constraint: `score=None` is
# correct there, not a missing value). The merged list interleaves that
# scoreless LightRAG order with the fusion channel's scored order via a plain
# round-robin (`_round_robin_merge`), which itself only ever reasons about
# POSITION, never magnitude — so by the time a candidate reaches this
# function, there is no single numeric score left to multiply that would mean
# the same thing for every candidate regardless of which channel it came
# from. A rank-only setting has exactly one meaningful notion of "attenuate a
# flagged candidate": rank it below every candidate that was NOT flagged.
# That is a stable partition, not a multiplicative rescale.
#
# WHY a stable partition also SOLVES double-penalization for free (see the
# task's explicit "beware double-penalisation" callout): the fusion channel,
# when `HARS_MEMORY_SUPERSESSION_SCORING` is on, ALREADY applies
# `apply_supersession_scoring`'s multiplicative attenuation to its OWN
# ranking before this function ever runs — so a flagged candidate's position
# in the merged list may already reflect that upstream demotion. Composing
# two MULTIPLICATIVE passes on the same content would compound
# (0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09, collapsing the rank further than either pass alone
# intends — the exact failure mode the task warns about). A stable partition
# does not have this problem: applying it a second time to its own output
# (or to an input where the same logical demotion already happened via a
# different mechanism upstream) is a NO-OP — every flagged candidate is
# already in the trailing group, in the same relative order, so re-applying
# the partition changes nothing further. This is IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION:
# f(f(x)) == f(x). No bookkeeping (e.g. threading a "was this candidate
# already penalized upstream" flag between `fusion.fuse()` and this call) is
# needed to prevent double-penalization — idempotency makes that bookkeeping
# unnecessary. The only observable effect of composing with an upstream pass
# is that a flagged candidate can end up demoted by (at most) one extra
# position relative to other *already-flagged* candidates it is tied with in
# the trailing group — never by an extra multiplicative factor.
#
# This is a STRONGER demotion than `apply_supersession_scoring`'s 0.3x (which
# can still let a flagged candidate beat a much-weaker unflagged one): a
# flagged candidate here always ranks last among survivors. That tradeoff is
# deliberately accepted for THIS caller only: the merged list is the final,
# user-visible top-k the calling agent reads as ground truth, not an
# intermediate ranking meant to preserve graded relevance for a downstream
# reranker — "below everything genuine" is the correct terminal answer for a
# self-declared-stale document at that point, not a graded discount.
