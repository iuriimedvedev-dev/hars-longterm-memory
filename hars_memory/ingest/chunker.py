"""Text chunker — Markdown-aware splitting with a character-window fallback.

Design constraints
------------------
- Pure Python, no LLM call.  This layer runs without the GPU.
- chunk_size and chunk_overlap come from config, never hardcoded.
- Returns a list of ``Chunk`` records for easy tracing.

Why Markdown-aware
------------------
A blind character window cuts documents mid-sentence, mid-code-fence and
mid-table, and — worse for retrieval — strips every chunk of the heading it
lived under.  A chunk reading "set ``replicaCount: 3``" is unrankable and
unusable without "## Scaling the ingress controller" above it.  So for content
that actually looks like Markdown (an ATX heading exists outside a code
fence) we split on H2/H3 boundaries and prepend the heading breadcrumb
(``# Doc > ## Section > ### Subsection``) to every chunk produced from that
section.

``chunk_size`` remains a hard upper bound: an oversized section is broken at
block boundaries (blank-line-separated paragraphs, with fenced code blocks and
pipe tables treated as indivisible units), and only a single block that is
itself larger than the budget falls back to the overlapping character window.

Non-Markdown input (plain prose, JSON, source code) keeps the original
overlapping character-window behaviour byte-for-byte — callers relying on that
(``corpus/build.py``, ``service/engines.py``) see no change.

Location metadata
-----------------
Every chunk also records where it came from: ``start_line``/``end_line``
(1-based, inclusive, in the *input* text), and for Markdown the full
``heading_path`` (H1..H6 titles in effect at the chunk's first character) plus
``section`` (the innermost title).  These are derived after chunking from the
chunk's character span, so they never influence where a chunk is cut and the
plain-window path emits exactly the same ``text`` as before.

Structure-aware mode (LightRAG index)
-------------------------------------
``chunk_markdown_structured`` is the stricter sibling used by the LightRAG
``chunking_func`` adapter (``lightrag_chunking_func``, enabled with
``HARS_MEMORY_CHUNKER=markdown``).  It splits at every heading level (H1-H6),
never lets text cross a heading boundary, keeps tables / fences / lists /
blockquotes / front-matter whole when they fit, and splits an oversized one by
its own rows or lines (repeating the table header, re-opening the fence, ...)
instead of a blind window.  Size is measured by a caller-supplied function
(tokens for LightRAG) rather than ``len``.  ``chunk_text`` is unaffected.
